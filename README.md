# Particle Simulation
A simple particle simulation created using Python and Pygame.

# Description
This project simulates the movement of particles on a screen using Pygame. Each particle moves randomly within the screen boundaries and bounces off the edges. The user can interact with the simulation by spawning new particles with a left mouse click and controlling certain aspects using keyboard inputs.

# Features
- Random particle generation
- Time freezing functionality
- Manual control of particle movement (left and right)
- Intuitive user interface with instructions displayed on the screen

# Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pygame

# Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/particle-simulation.git
```

# Usage
1. Navigate to the directory
```
cd particle-simulation
```
# Run
